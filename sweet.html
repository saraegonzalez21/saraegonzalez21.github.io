            <h2>Vegan Lemon Cinnamon Scones</h2>

            <img src="photos/Scone-1.jpg" class="photo">
            <p class="opening-comments">These are literally my favorite quick and easy scones to whip up anytime I need something vaguely sweet.
                This is the first variety of scones I ever tried and I'm excited to share with all of you! Super simple and scones are very forgiving, no need to weigh flour 
                or ensure your oil is the exact right temperature, otherwise the entire baked good will fall apart. Quick. Easy. Simple. 
                My favorite things. So let's get cooking...
            </p>
            <div class="ingredients">
                Ingredients
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4 cup coconut oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup nut milk + extra for brushing</li>
                <li>Zest of 1-2 lemons</li>
                <li>Juice of 1-2 lemons</li>
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <ol>Preheat oven to 375F & line a baking sheet with parchment paper</ol>
                <ol>In a bowl whisk together:
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Sugar</li>
                    <li>Baking Powder</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Cinnamon</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>Add coconut oil and cut in with a pastry cutter (or your hands) until the texture is crumbly</ol>
                <ol>Add:
                    <li>Nut milk</li>
                    <li>Zest of lemon(s)</li>
                    <li>Juice of lemon(s)</li>
                </ol>
                <ol>Lightly mix together - do not overmix! It will cause your scone to become chewy</ol>
                <ol>Transfer dough to parchment paper and pat into two circles 1" high</ol>
                <ol>Cut into 8 triangular slices per circle (16 total) and move to create space between triangles</ol>
                <ol>Brush tops and sides with extra nut milk</ol>
                <ol>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown (ish)</ol>
                <ol> ENJOY!</ol>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <img src="photos/about-image.JPG" class="about-image" alt="Girl on roof">
            <p>I've always been interested in food since my first semester freshman year of high school. My first elective was
                a food preperation class. We learned how to make pancakes from scratch (I'd only ever known pancakes from a box or frozen), cookies,
                homemade mac and cheese. Yum. My love of cooking only amplified when I moved to New York and cooking my own meals was 
                cheaper than buying a sad salad everyday, womp womp. So here we are, this is a compilation of my favorite receipes -
                some are of my own creation, others are modified from other sources. I hope you'll join me on this delicious journey.
