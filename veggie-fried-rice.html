            <h2>Veggie Fried Rice</h2>
            <img src="Photos/fried-rice.jpg" class="photo">
            <p class="opening-comments">Veggie fried rice people!!! How exciting - honestly I started making this when I was broke and living with four roommates.
                Again, super quick, super easy, semi healthy - it's the veggies! I eat this as a main dish as I've heard fried rice is not
                to be eaten as a side. Full dish all day, every day. Feel free to swap in your favorite veggies or whatever you have on hand
                is totally fine too - feel free to mix it up. So let's get cooking...

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <img src="photos/about-image.JPG" class="about-image" alt="Girl on roof">
            <p>I've always been interested in food since my first semester freshman year of high school. My first elective was
                a food preperation class. We learned how to make pancakes from scratch (I'd only ever known pancakes from a box or frozen), cookies,
                homemade mac and cheese. Yum. My love of cooking only amplified when I moved to New York and cooking my own meals was 
                cheaper than buying a sad salad everyday, womp womp. So here we are, this is a compilation of my favorite receipes -
                some are of my own creation, others are modified from other sources. I hope you'll join me on this delicious journey.
